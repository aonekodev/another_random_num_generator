# another_random_num_generator

I was asked to develop a random number generator by my client which is literally unique random number generator or 
maybe it is some sort of hard to find thing on the internet. I finally decided to share it as an opensource.

What it does ?
- You the set start value, the end value and the number of random numbers will output with the number of times it set when the "Roll" button is pressed.
The output values will display randomly with no duplicate values between these start and end values.

Where to use?
- It was used in lucky draw session of company annual staff party. As it output multiple values randomly without duplication
in the limit of number of times, you can use it what is best for you.
